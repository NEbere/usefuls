database locking mechanisms for SQL and no SQL as it realtes to concurrency
in distributed systems
------------------------

One of the important aspects of distributed systems is achieveing concurrent transparency.
Concurrent transparency is when a distributed system is able to achive concurrent execution of 
requests with shared resources without users knowledge.

For instance, users editing a record in the same DB table at the same time.
Aside from users not knowing others are using or making change to the same resource
same time as they are, another important thing is that the resource needs to be 
in a consistent state after the processes are complete by the independent users.

One of the ways to achieve this consistency can be through locking mechanisms, in which users are given 
exclusive access in turn to the resource in question.

this post talks about how locking works with SQL and NoSQL databases, and specifically,
MySQL and MongoDB.

While some of the features mentioned here are peculiar to the DBMS (database management system) mentioned, 
many are shared acrossed other SQL and NoSQL systems.
