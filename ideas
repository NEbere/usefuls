How to check cloudwatch logs for errors on lambda

- go to AWS console
- under services, select 'Lambda'
- search for and select the desired function name on the list of available functions
- on the function page, select the 'Monitoring' tab
- on the 'Monitoring' tab, click on 'view logs in Cloudwatch'
- on the cloudwatch page that you will be redirected to from the lambda page,
select a log group, targeting the time when the error was encountered.
NB: take note of the time zones, between when you received the error and the time of thenlocation 
you are accessing/running AWS from  and convert accordingly so you know what time to target for the search

- After selecting the time frame from the previous step, you land on the log group page.
Here you can search for a desired metirc. This can be a AWS lambda metric or custom metric logged by your code.
In this post, we will search for a custom metric 'filtered'

- A search for error will show you the errors that happened during the time of interest selected.
- any of these metrics can be searched for:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-metrics.html

Also, custom metrics can be searched for

Learnings:

- when running a script that prints to console or has an output stament
you can use the command '> <random_file_name>' while running the script
 to print that output to the random_file_name

example:
node syncLastActive.js > qwe2.out

will save the outputs of console to qwe2.out file. it will creat new one
if it doesnt exist and update an exising one.


- To read the inputs that will be sent to the file from above (qwe2.out)
as they are been written, you can use the command:

tail -f qwe2.out

This will display what is written to that file on the screen as
they are been written




Useful questions:
When someone brings up an hypothesis about something, and a fix or experiment,
ask how they intend to test out the results of this implementation against that hypothesis
Eg: How do you know implementing this feature will change A or B, and how 
will you measure the implementation of this feature, specifically.
